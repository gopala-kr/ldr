## A Short History of JavaScript

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.

In 1996 - 1997 JavaScript was taken to ECMA to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape. The work done over this period of time eventually led to the official release of ECMA-262 Ed.1: ECMAScript is the name of the official standard, with JavaScript being the most well known of the implementations. ActionScript 3 is another well-known implementation of ECMAScript, with extensions (see below).

The standards process continued in cycles, with releases of ECMAScript 2 in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in 1999, which is the baseline for modern day JavaScript. The "JS2" or "original ES4" work led by Waldemar Horwat (then of Netscape, now at Google) started in 2000 and at first, Microsoft seemed to participate and even implemented some of the proposals in their JScript.net language.

Over time it was clear though that Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper JS in IE, even though they had no competing proposal and they had a partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the .NET server side. So by 2003 the JS2/original-ES4 work was mothballed.

The next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript’s history. First, Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma as a not-for-profit member and work started on E4X, ECMA-357, which came from ex-Microsoft employees at BEA (originally acquired as Crossgain). This led to working jointly with Macromedia, who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3(ActionScript 3 was a fork of Waldemar's JS2/original-ES4 work).

So, along with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe), work restarted on ECMAScript 4 with the goal of standardizing what was in AS3 and implementing it in SpiderMonkey. To this end, Adobe released the "AVM2", code named Tamarin, as an open source project. But Tamarin and AS3 were too different from web JavaScript to converge, as was realized by the parties in 2007 and 2008.

Alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; Doug Crockford — then at Yahoo! — joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript 3.1 effort.

While all of this was happening the open source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript. This community effort was sparked in 2005 when Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and resulting in more dynamic applications. This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo and Mootools and others being released.

In July of 2008 the disparate parties on either side came together in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5 and drive the language forward using an agenda that is known as Harmony.

All of this then brings us to today, with JavaScript entering a completely new and exciting cycle of evolution, innovation and standardisation, with new developments such as the Nodejs platform, allowing us to use JavaScript on the server-side, and HTML5 APIs to control user media, open up web sockets for always-on communication, get data on geographical location and device features such as accelerometer, and more. It is an exciting time to learn JavaScript.

## Nodejs

Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based framework/platform built on Google Chrome's
JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video
streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open
source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.



Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and other developers working at Joyent in 2009. In 2011, the Node Package Manager, called NPM was released and it allowed for the sharing of open-source libraries. As the Node community grew, some conflicts started to emerge about the management of Node releases. The users wanted a project governed by the open-source community rather than a corporation. They also wanted to be able to incorporate the latest language and API features faster. So in December 2014, io.js created a fork of the Node.js project and went onto release several versions of io.js.

Then in February of 2015, it was announced that a neutral Node.js foundation would be formed. A promise that was fulfilled in June of 2015 when Node.js and io.js voted to work together under the new Node.js foundation. The Node.js foundation is made up of several large companies including IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Groupon and, of course, Joyent. It's referred to as a collaborative project by the Linux foundation. Officially on September 14, 2015, the Node.js foundation announced that the Node.js and io.js would be combined in a single code base and released as Node.js version 4.0.

Included in the new release are a ton of new ES6 features and a plan for a regular release cycle. From the start of the Node.js project, a common refrain was that all versions of Node.js would be 0 releases, .08, .010, .012 until the project could release a stable version 1.0 with no breaking changes. Well, with the release of Node.js version 4.0, the much-awaited version 1.0 never happened. But now the community is united with the official Node release at version 4.0.


**How nodejs works**

- I'm going to demonstrate how Node.js works and why it is so fast by taking a look at two restaurants. The first restaurant is Apache Steaks and Chops. It is a big, nice, fancy restaurant. In this restaurant, every new guest represents a new user, and making an order is like making a request. If I place an order for a salad, the manager will need to hire a new waiter to take care of me. In this restaurant, our waiter represents a thread. We are going to have our own waiter, our own thread, and they will handle all of our orders. This is similar to how Apache works.

Every request is single-threaded. After placing the order, the waiter will take the order to the kitchen and give it to the chef. And now the waiter just waits. He won't do anything else until the chef is finished making the food. I would like to order a glass of water, but I can't order anything until the chef finishes making that salad. The chef is blocking me from being able to simply order a glass of water. In this analogy, the chef represents the file system or a data store. In Apache, the single thread waits for the file system to finish reading files before it can do anything else.

We refer to this as blocking. Finally, my salad is ready. My waiter brings me the food. I can order my glass of water, and my waiter also brings me that, too. My request has been served. And now the manager is firing my waiter because they are not needed anymore. Now, when this restaurant gets busy for dinner service, every guest has their own waiter, which is pretty nice. That is pretty good service, but the waiters are mostly hanging around the kitchen and waiting for the chef to make the food. If this restaurant gets really popular, it requires a lot of space to expand because more guests means more waiters.

Now, let's take a look at this other cafe, Chez Node. At this cafe, there is only one waiter because Node.js is single-threaded. Here, we can order some crepes. We can see that our waiter places the order for the food, then moves on to take an order from another new table. Hmm, this single thread services all of the restaurant guests. That is pretty cool. When my crepes are ready, the chef rings a bell, and our waiter goes and gets the crepes and delivers them to me. He then proceeds to take another order from a new table. When their food is ready, the waiter will bring it to them as soon as he can.

We can say that this waiter behaves asynchronously. Everything this waiter needs to do represents a new event, a new table, placing orders, delivering orders. These are all events, and they will get handled in the order that they are raised. Our waiter does not wait. There is no blocking. Our single waiter is busy, busy, busy, but he is killing it because he can multitask. This is what it means when we say nonblocking, event-driven IO. We have a single thread that will respond to events in the order that they are raised.

This thread behaves asynchronously because it does not have to wait for resources to finish doing what they're doing before our thread can do anything else. If this cafe gets popular, we can simply franchise it. Chez Node can easily be expanded by simply duplicating or forking the restaurant into a neighboring space. And this is precisely how we host Node.js applications in the cloud. Now, remember, Node.js is single-threaded. All of the users are sharing the same thread. Events are raised and recorded in an event queue and then handled in the order that they were raised.

Node.js is asynchronous, which means that it can do more than one thing at a time. This ability to multitask is what makes Node.js so fast and one of the reasons so many developers are building their web applications with Node.js.
