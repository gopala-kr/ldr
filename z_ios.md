**native platforms:** ios, android, windows

**cross-platforms:** phonegap/apache cordova, xamarin, unity, appcelerator 


**************************

Before starting with actual subjective topics, lets undestand some required terminologies:

* Mobile OS?
* Native platform apps?
* Cross-platform apps?
* Available softwares, platforms and tools for mobile app development
* Mobile app architectural/design patterns

**(In this article I intended to study only the core technical concepts and some brief survey on mobile app industry)**

## mobile operating system

Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use; usually including, and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems; a touchscreen, cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Protected Access, Wi-Fi, Global Positioning System (GPS) mobile navigation, [[Digital camera|single-frame picture cameras]/video camera, speech recognition, voice recorder, music player, near field communication, and infrared blaster. 

* By the end of 2016, over 430 million smartphones were sold with 81.7 percent running Android, 17.9 percent running iOS, 0.3 percent running Windows Mobile and the other OSes cover 0.1 percent. Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows, and in general smartphone use (even without tablets) outnumber desktop use (desktop use, web use, overall is down to 44.9% in the first quarter of 2017).

* Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities (e.g., smartphones) contain two mobile operating systems – the main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware. 

* Research has shown that these low-level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device.

* Mobile operating systems have majority use as of 2017 (measured by web use); with even only the smartphones running them (excluding tablets) more used than any other kind of device. Thus traditional desktop OS is now a minority used kind of OS; see usage share of operating systems. However, variations occur in popularity by regions, while desktop-minority also applies on some days in regions such as United States and United Kingdom.

### Native platform mobile apps

A native mobile app is an application which meets the requirements of a particular operating system by using its SDK (as well as hardware memory, gear and other applications installed on a device).


### Cross-platform-mobile app

A cross-platform application is a mobile app which is compatible with multiple operating systems and can therefore run on any smartphone or tablet.

<br>

There are two types of cross-platform mobile applications:

<br>

**Native cross-platform apps:** Each operating system has its SDK and major tech stack (Java for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS app development). An experienced mobile vendor, however, can create a unified API running on top of a native Software Development Kit and use the same codebase for both Android ad iOS apps. Native cross-platform applications are primarily built with Xamarin and Appcelerator Titanium;

<br>

**Hybrid HTML5 applications:**  Although mobile applications are designed for smartphones and tablets, it is backend servers (either on-prem or Cloud-based) that handle application logic. Since both iOS and Android SDKs feature advanced web components, skilled software engineers often utilize WebView to create parts of an application’s GUI (Graphical User Interface) with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The most popular hybrid app development framework is Apache Cordova (formerly known as PhoneGap).



<br>

There are some articles which discusses about pros and cons of native and cross-platforms apps:

* [Why we are not cross-platform developers](https://android.jlelse.eu/why-we-are-not-cross-platform-developers-fd7ef70e976d)

## mobile application development platforms and tools:


<p>The platform organizations needed to develop, deploy and manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app" title="Mobile app">mobile apps</a> are made from many components and tools which allow a developer to write, test and deploy applications into the target platform environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Front-end_development_tools">Front-end development tools</span></h3>
<p>Front-end development tools are focused on the user interface and user experience (UI-UX) and provide the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI design tools</li>
<li>SDKs to access device features</li>
<li>Cross-platform accommodations/support</li>
</ul>

Available [platforms and tools](https://github.com/gopala-kr/weekend-with-github/blob/master/Projects-Blogs/04-mobile-dev/front-end-tools.md)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Back-end_servers">Back-end servers</span></h3>
<p>Back-end tools pick up where the front-end tools leave off, and provide a set of reusable services that are centrally managed and controlled and provide the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with back-end systems</li>
<li>User authentication-authorization</li>
<li>Data services</li>
<li>Reusable business logic</li>
</ul>

<p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" title="Bring your own device">bring your own device</a> (BYOD) becoming the norm within more enterprises, IT departments often need stop-gap, tactical solutions that layer atop existing apps, phones, and platform component. Features include</p>
<ul>
<li>App wrapping for security</li>
<li>Data encryption</li>
<li>Client actions</li>
<li>Reporting and statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="System_software">System software</span></h3>
<p>Many system-level components are needed to have a functioning platform for developing mobile apps.</p>

<br>

* Criteria for selecting a development platform usually contains the target mobile platforms, existing infrastructure and development skills. When targeting more than one platform with cross-platform development it is also important to consider the impact of the tool on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" title="User experience">user experience</a>. 
  
* Performance is another important criteria, as research on mobile apps indicates a strong correlation between application performance and user satisfaction. Along with performance and other criteria, the availability of the technology and the project's requirement may drive the development between native and cross-platform environments. 

* To aid the choice between native and cross-platform environments, some guidelines and benchmarks have been published. Typically, cross-platform environments are reusable across multiple platforms, leveraging a native container while using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface. In contrast, native environments are targeted at one platform for each of those environments. For example, Android development occurs in the Eclipse IDE using Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugins, Apple iOS development occurs using Xcode IDE with Objective-C and/or Swift, Windows and BlackBerry each have their own development environments.

# Native Mobile app Development
********
## iOS

> ** brief history of ios**

> In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.

> The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop applications", but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS". Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.

> The iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008 with an initial 500 applications available. This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008, 15,000 in January 2009, 50,000 in June 2009, 100,000 in November 2009, 250,000 in August 2010, 650,000 in July 2012, 1 million in October 2013, 2 million in June 2016, and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of March 2016, 1 million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer. These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower has estimated that the App Store will reach 5 million apps by the year 2020.

> In September 2007, Apple announced the iPod Touch, a redesigned iPod based on the iPhone form factor. In January 2010, Apple announced the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading.

> In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.

> In October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II's new campus.

> Software updates

iPhone OS 1, iPhone OS 2, iPhone OS 3, iOS 4, iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11

Platform usage as measured by the App Store on September 6, 2017.

  iOS 10 (89%)
  iOS 9 (9%)
  iOS 8 and earlier (2%)
Apple provides major updates to the iOS operating system annually via iTunes and also, for iOS 5 and later, over-the-air. The latest version is iOS 11, released on September 19, 2017. It is available for iPhone 5S and later, iPad Air and later, iPad Pro, iPad Mini 2 and later, and sixth-generation iPod Touch.

Originally, iPod Touch users had to pay for system software updates. This was due to accounting rules making the device not a "subscription device" like iPhone or Apple TV, and significant enhancements to the device required payments. The requirement to pay to upgrade caused iPod Touch owners to stay away from updates.[53] However, in September 2009, a change in accounting rules won tentative approval, significantly affecting both Apple's earnings and stock price, and allowing iPod Touch updates to be delivered for free.
