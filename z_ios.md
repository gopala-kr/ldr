**native platforms:** ios, android, windows

**cross-platforms:** phonegap/apache cordova, xamarin, unity, appcelerator 


**************************

Before starting with actual subjective topics, lets undestand some required terminologies:

* Mobile OS?
* Native platform apps?
* Cross-platform apps?
* Available softwares, platforms and tools for mobile app development
* Mobile app architectural/design patterns

**(In this article I intended to study only the core technical concepts and some brief survey on mobile app industry)**

## mobile operating system

Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use; usually including, and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems; a touchscreen, cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Protected Access, Wi-Fi, Global Positioning System (GPS) mobile navigation, [[Digital camera|single-frame picture cameras]/video camera, speech recognition, voice recorder, music player, near field communication, and infrared blaster. 

* By the end of 2016, over 430 million smartphones were sold with 81.7 percent running Android, 17.9 percent running iOS, 0.3 percent running Windows Mobile and the other OSes cover 0.1 percent. Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows, and in general smartphone use (even without tablets) outnumber desktop use (desktop use, web use, overall is down to 44.9% in the first quarter of 2017).

* Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities (e.g., smartphones) contain two mobile operating systems – the main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware. 

* Research has shown that these low-level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device.

* Mobile operating systems have majority use as of 2017 (measured by web use); with even only the smartphones running them (excluding tablets) more used than any other kind of device. Thus traditional desktop OS is now a minority used kind of OS; see usage share of operating systems. However, variations occur in popularity by regions, while desktop-minority also applies on some days in regions such as United States and United Kingdom.

### Native platform mobile apps

A native mobile app is an application which meets the requirements of a particular operating system by using its SDK (as well as hardware memory, gear and other applications installed on a device).


### Cross-platform-mobile app

A cross-platform application is a mobile app which is compatible with multiple operating systems and can therefore run on any smartphone or tablet.

<br>

There are two types of cross-platform mobile applications:

<br>

**Native cross-platform apps:** Each operating system has its SDK and major tech stack (Java for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS app development). An experienced mobile vendor, however, can create a unified API running on top of a native Software Development Kit and use the same codebase for both Android ad iOS apps. Native cross-platform applications are primarily built with Xamarin and Appcelerator Titanium;

<br>

**Hybrid HTML5 applications:**  Although mobile applications are designed for smartphones and tablets, it is backend servers (either on-prem or Cloud-based) that handle application logic. Since both iOS and Android SDKs feature advanced web components, skilled software engineers often utilize WebView to create parts of an application’s GUI (Graphical User Interface) with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The most popular hybrid app development framework is Apache Cordova (formerly known as PhoneGap).



<br>

There are some articles which discusses about pros and cons of native and cross-platforms apps:

* [Why we are not cross-platform developers](https://android.jlelse.eu/why-we-are-not-cross-platform-developers-fd7ef70e976d)

## mobile application development platforms and tools:


<p>The platform organizations needed to develop, deploy and manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app" title="Mobile app">mobile apps</a> are made from many components and tools which allow a developer to write, test and deploy applications into the target platform environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Front-end_development_tools">Front-end development tools</span></h3>
<p>Front-end development tools are focused on the user interface and user experience (UI-UX) and provide the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI design tools</li>
<li>SDKs to access device features</li>
<li>Cross-platform accommodations/support</li>
</ul>

Available [platforms and tools](https://github.com/gopala-kr/weekend-with-github/blob/master/Projects-Blogs/04-mobile-dev/front-end-tools.md)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Back-end_servers">Back-end servers</span></h3>
<p>Back-end tools pick up where the front-end tools leave off, and provide a set of reusable services that are centrally managed and controlled and provide the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with back-end systems</li>
<li>User authentication-authorization</li>
<li>Data services</li>
<li>Reusable business logic</li>
</ul>

<p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" title="Bring your own device">bring your own device</a> (BYOD) becoming the norm within more enterprises, IT departments often need stop-gap, tactical solutions that layer atop existing apps, phones, and platform component. Features include</p>
<ul>
<li>App wrapping for security</li>
<li>Data encryption</li>
<li>Client actions</li>
<li>Reporting and statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="System_software">System software</span></h3>
<p>Many system-level components are needed to have a functioning platform for developing mobile apps.</p>

<br>

* Criteria for selecting a development platform usually contains the target mobile platforms, existing infrastructure and development skills. When targeting more than one platform with cross-platform development it is also important to consider the impact of the tool on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" title="User experience">user experience</a>. 
  
* Performance is another important criteria, as research on mobile apps indicates a strong correlation between application performance and user satisfaction. Along with performance and other criteria, the availability of the technology and the project's requirement may drive the development between native and cross-platform environments. 

* To aid the choice between native and cross-platform environments, some guidelines and benchmarks have been published. Typically, cross-platform environments are reusable across multiple platforms, leveraging a native container while using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface. In contrast, native environments are targeted at one platform for each of those environments. For example, Android development occurs in the Eclipse IDE using Android Developer Tools (ADT) plugins, Apple iOS development occurs using Xcode IDE with Objective-C and/or Swift, Windows and BlackBerry each have their own development environments.

# Native Mobile app Development
********
## iOS

> **brief history of ios**

> In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.

> The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At the time of its unveiling in January, Steve Jobs claimed: "iPhone runs OS X" and runs "desktop applications", but at the time of the iPhone's release, the operating system was renamed "iPhone OS". Initially, third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". In October 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple held a press event, announcing the iPhone SDK.

> The iOS App Store was opened on July 10, 2008 with an initial 500 applications available. This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008, 15,000 in January 2009, 50,000 in June 2009, 100,000 in November 2009, 250,000 in August 2010, 650,000 in July 2012, 1 million in October 2013, 2 million in June 2016, and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of March 2016, 1 million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer. These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower has estimated that the App Store will reach 5 million apps by the year 2020.

> In September 2007, Apple announced the iPod Touch, a redesigned iPod based on the iPhone form factor. In January 2010, Apple announced the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading.

> In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.

> In October 2016, Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II's new campus.

> Software updates

> Major versions of iOS are released annually. The current version, iOS 11, was released on September 19, 2017. It is available for all iOS devices with 64-bit processors; the iPhone 5S and later iPhone models, the iPad (2017), the iPad Air and later iPad Air models, all iPad Pro models, the iPad Mini 2 and later iPad Mini models, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch.

> Platform usage as measured by the App Store on September 6, 2017.

>   * iOS 10 (89%)
>   * iOS 9 (9%)
>   * iOS 8 and earlier (2%)
  
> Apple provides major updates to the iOS operating system annually via iTunes and also, for iOS 5 and later, over-the-air. The latest version is iOS 11, released on September 19, 2017. It is available for iPhone 5S and later, iPad Air and later, iPad Pro, iPad Mini 2 and later, and sixth-generation iPod Touch.

> Originally, iPod Touch users had to pay for system software updates. This was due to accounting rules making the device not a "subscription device" like iPhone or Apple TV, and significant enhancements to the device required payments. The requirement to pay to upgrade caused iPod Touch owners to stay away from updates. However, in September 2009, a change in accounting rules won tentative approval, significantly affecting both Apple's earnings and stock price, and allowing iPod Touch updates to be delivered for free.

## iOS Technologies

iOS is the operating system that runs on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch devices. The operating system manages the device hardware and provides the technologies required to implement native apps. The operating system also ships with various system apps, such as Phone, Mail, and Safari, that provide standard system services to the user.

The iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) contains the tools and interfaces needed to develop, install, run, and test native apps that appear on an iOS device’s Home screen. Native apps are built using the iOS system frameworks and Objective-C language and run directly on iOS. Unlike web apps, native apps are installed physically on a device and are therefore always available to the user, even when the device is in Airplane mode. They reside next to other system apps, and both the app and any user data is synced to the user’s computer through iTunes.

> The iOS SDK provides the resources you need to develop native iOS apps.


The iOS Architecture Is Layered and it looks very simple as compared to android at high level abstraction

At the highest level, iOS acts as an intermediary between the underlying hardware and the apps you create. Apps do not talk to the underlying hardware directly. Instead, they communicate with the hardware through a set of well-defined system interfaces. These interfaces make it easy to write apps that work consistently on devices having different hardware capabilities.

The implementation of iOS technologies can be viewed as a set of layers. Lower layers contain fundamental services and technologies. Higher-level layers build upon the lower layers and provide more sophisticated services and technologies.

![](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/iPhoneOSTechOverview/Art/SystemLayers_2x.png)


### Core OS Layer

The Core OS layer contains the low-level features that most other technologies are built upon. Even if you do not use these technologies directly in your apps, they are most likely being used by other frameworks. And in situations where you need to explicitly deal with security or communicating with an external hardware accessory, you do so using the frameworks in this layer.

### Core Services Layer

The Core Services layer contains fundamental system services for apps. Key among these services are the Core Foundation and Foundation frameworks, which define the basic types that all apps use. This layer also contains individual technologies to support features such as location, iCloud, social media, and networking.

### Media Layer

The Media layer contains the graphics, audio, and video technologies you use to implement multimedia experiences in your apps. The technologies in this layer make it easy for you to build apps that look and sound great.

more details from official doc [Media Layer](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/iPhoneOSTechOverview/MediaLayer/MediaLayer.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007898-CH9-SW4)

### Cocoa Touch Layer

The Cocoa Touch layer contains key frameworks for building iOS apps. These frameworks define the appearance of your app. They also provide the basic app infrastructure and support for key technologies such as multitasking, touch-based input, push notifications, and many high-level system services. When designing your apps, you should investigate the technologies in this layer first to see if they meet your needs.

## Required developmenet tools & pre-requesites

* Should have hands on knowledge on Objective C and Swift

* Development of iOS apps requires an Intel-based Macintosh computer with the iOS SDK installed. For information about how to get the iOS SDK, go to the [iOS Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com/download/)

## iOS App Architecture

Apps need to work with the iOS to ensure that they deliver a great user experience. Beyond just a good design for your app’s design and user interface, a great user experience encompasses many other factors. Users expect iOS apps to be fast and responsive while expecting the app to use as little power as possible. Apps need to support all of the latest iOS devices while still appearing as if the app was tailored for the current device. Implementing all of these behaviors can seem daunting at first but iOS provides the help you need to make it happen.

**Apps Are Expected to Support Key Features**

The system expects every app to have some specific resources and configuration data, such as an app icon and information about the capabilities of the app. Xcode provides some information with every new project but you must supply resource files and you must make sure the information in your project is correct before submitting your app.

**Apps Follow Well-Defined Execution Paths**

From the time the user launches an app to the time it quits, apps follow a well-defined execution path. During the life of an app, it can transition between foreground and background execution, it can be terminated and relaunched, and it can go to sleep temporarily. Each time it transitions to a new state, the expectations for the app change. A foreground app can do almost anything but background apps must do as little as possible. You use the state transitions to adjust your app’s behaviors accordingly.

**Apps Must Run Efficiently in a Multitasking Environment**

Battery life is important for users, as is performance, responsiveness, and a great user experience. Minimizing your app’s usage of the battery ensures that the user can run your app all day without having to recharge the device, but launching and being ready to run quickly are also important. The iOS multitasking implementation offers good battery life without sacrificing the responsiveness and user experience that users expect, but the implementation requires apps to adopt system-provided behaviors.

**Communication Between Apps Follows Specific Pathways**

For security, iOS apps run in a sandbox and have limited interactions with other apps. When you want to communicate with other apps on the system, there are specific ways to do so.

**Performance Tuning is Important for Apps**

Every task performed by an app has a power cost associated with it. Apps that drain the user’s battery create a negative user experience and are more likely to be deleted than those that appear to run for days on a single charge. So be aware of the cost of different operations and take advantage of power-saving measures offered by the system.

The system frameworks provide the basic infrastructure that all apps need to run, and you provide the code required to customize that infrastructure and give the app the look and feel you want. To do that effectively, it helps to understand a little bit about the iOS infrastructure and how it works. </p><p>iOS frameworks rely on design patterns such as <span class="pediaLink" data-header="Model-View-Controller" data-contents="The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern assigns objects in an application one of three roles: model, view, or controller.

Understanding those design patterns is crucial to the successful creation of an app. It also helps to be familiar with the Objective-C language and its features.

The <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication" target="_self" class="urlLink">UIApplication</a></code> object sets up the main run loop at launch time and uses it to process events and handle updates to view-based interfaces.

This behavior ensures that user-related events are processed serially in the order in which they were received.</p><p><span class="content_text">Figure 2-2</span> shows the architecture of the main run loop and how user events result in actions taken by your app. As the user interacts with a device, events related to those interactions are generated by the system and delivered to the app via a special port set up by UIKit. Events are queued internally by the app and dispatched one-by-one to the main run loop for execution. The <code>UIApplication</code> object is the first object to receive the event and make the decision about what needs to be done. A touch event is usually dispatched to the main window object, which in turn dispatches it to the view in which the touch occurred. Other events might take slightly different paths through various app objects.</p><figure class="figure"><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH2-SW15" title="Figure 2-2Processing events in the main run loop"></a><figcaption><strong class="caption_number">Figure 2-2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing events in the main run loop</figcaption><img src="../Art/event_draw_cycle_a_2x.png" alt="Processing events in the main run loop" width="608" height="406"></figure><p>Many types of events can be delivered in an iOS app. The most common ones are listed in <span class="content_text">Table 2-2</span>.

System-initiated termination is a normal part of an app’s life cycle. The system usually terminates apps so that it can reclaim memory and make room for other apps being launched by the user, but the system may also terminate apps that are misbehaving or not responding to events in a timely manner.</p><p>Suspended apps receive no notification when they are terminated; the system kills the process and reclaims the corresponding memory. If an app is currently running in the background and not suspended, the system calls the <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623111-applicationwillterminate" target="_self" class="urlLink">applicationWillTerminate:</a></code> of its app delegate prior to termination. The system does not call this method when the device reboots. </p><p>In addition to the system terminating your app, the user can terminate your app explicitly using the multitasking UI. User-initiated termination has the same effect as terminating a suspended app. The app’s process is killed and no notification is sent to the app.</p></section><section><a name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH2-SW8" title="Threads and Concurrency"></a><h2 class="jump">Threads and Concurrency</h2><p>The system creates your app’s main thread and you can create additional threads, as needed, to perform other tasks. For iOS apps, the preferred technique is to use Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), operation objects, and other asynchronous programming interfaces rather than creating and managing threads yourself. Technologies such as GCD let you define the work you want to do and the order you want to do it in, but let the system decide how best to execute that work on the available CPUs. Letting the system handle the thread management simplifies the code you must write, makes it easier to ensure the correctness of that code, and offers better overall performance. </p><p>When thinking about threads and concurrency, consider the following:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p>Work involving views, Core Animation, and many other UIKit classes usually must occur on the app’s main thread. There are some exceptions to this rule—for example, image-based manipulations can often occur on background threads—but when in doubt, assume that work needs to happen on the main thread. </p></li><li class="li"><p>Lengthy tasks (or potentially length tasks) should always be performed on a background thread. Any tasks involving network access, file access, or large amounts of data processing should all be performed asynchronously using GCD or operation objects.</p></li><li class="li"><p>At launch time, move tasks off the main thread whenever possible. At launch time, your app should use the available time to set up its user interface as quickly as possible. Only tasks that contribute to setting up the user interface should be performed on the main thread. All other tasks should be executed asynchronously, with the results displayed to the user as soon as they are ready. </p></li></ul><p>For more information about using GCD and operation objects to execute tasks, see <em><a href="../../../../General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008091" data-renderer-version="1" target="_self">Concurrency Programming Guide</a></em>. </p></section>
