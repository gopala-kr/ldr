I have given soometime to explore react ecosystem from last friday. Yet react is a big tech ecosystem to learn completely in one week, I wanted to understand the core concepts behind it. I have bit of experience in full-stack web apps using SAP technologies(past 3 years); webdypro applications(frontend is drag and drop UI library, backend completely in ABAP); CRM webui , Hybris(an e-commerce platform - front end is js stack, backend is CRM), extensive experience in webservices and API's; bit of learned knowledge on Fiori app development using SAPUI5 library. Recently my curiouses of learning has taken my attention me towards open source libraries and frameworks. I have been fascinated by open source concept and its potential impact on developer community; started exploring bit-by-bit.

I always use my below table to get gist of anything new in technology:

React is a bueatiful JavaScript library for building frontend user interfaces. React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. React processes only user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS. [Source : wikipedia]

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by Angular and XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

React is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.

Stack Overflow has released its much-anticipated Developer Survey for 2017. This year, over 64,000 developers took part in the survey and shared their preferences. below are stats for survey on frameworks and libraes; react stands in the top list.
