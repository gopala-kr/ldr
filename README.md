I have given soometime to explore react ecosystem from last friday. Yet react is a big tech ecosystem to learn completely in one week, I wanted to understand the core concepts behind it. I have bit of experience in full-stack web apps using SAP technologies(past 3 years): webdypro applications(frontend is drag and drop UI library, backend completely in ABAP); CRM webui ; Hybris(an e-commerce platform - front end is js stack, backend is CRM); extensive experience in webservices and API's; bit of learned knowledge on Fiori app development using SAPUI5 library. My curiousnes of learning has drawn me towards open source libraries and frameworks. I have been fascinated by concept of open source and its potential impact on developer community; I have started exploring it bit-by-bit.

I always use my below table to get gist of anything new in technology:

React is a beautiful JavaScript library for building frontend user interfaces. React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. React processes only user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS. [Source : wikipedia]

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by Angular and XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

React is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.

There are almost 2K blogs,articles and tutorials teaching about react every month and it is most trending buzz word in hacker news commuinity. Stack Overflow has released its much-anticipated Developer Survey for 2017. This year, over 64,000 developers took part in the survey and shared their preferences. below are the stats for survey on frameworks and libraries; react stands in the top list.

React has been adopted by top giants Facebook, Instagram, NetflixNY, TimesKhan Academy, Codecademy, WhatsApp, Vivaldi,  Browser Dropbox,  Yahoo Mail and startup communities [more](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react). and react has been a big competetor for google's AngularJs MVC framework.

React is just a front end UI library, which elegantly manages application states. Inorder to make complete full stack application facebook and other communities provides supporting libraries, such as flux, redux, relay, graphql. We will explore them in details.


## React:



## Redux



## Relay




## GraphQL

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org), a query language that is starting to get more and more attention. Facebook, who internally used GraphQL since 2012 and released a first specification and reference implementation of GraphQL in 2015 announced GraphQL to be [production ready] in September 2016. What followed is a trend of more and more companies starting to use GraphQL, such as [GitHub](https://youtu.be/hT-4pVmkGt0), [Coursera](https://youtu.be/JC-UJwBKc2Y) and [Shopify](https://youtu.be/Wlu_PWCjc6Y).

One of the main benefits of using GraphQL is how so called queries allow clients to specify their data requirements in a declarative way. Instead of collecting all the data from different endpoints, as is usual with REST, queries allow an exact and fine-grained selection of data fields that are then resolved by the server. This leads to prevention of data over- and underfetching, two common problems of REST.
