## content management systems & web services

* Wordpress
* Drupal
* joomla
* Webservices

In layman words, content Management Systems, or CMSs, are platforms that provide graphical interfaces for website management. This means that images, video, text, and even many elements of a website’s layout can be edited by users without the need for any coding or programming.

Broadly speaking, content management describes any system that allows people to more easily change and update content, especially on their websites. When the content (number of pages, images, etc.), and/or the number of contributors, grows large, a content management system (CMS) helps collect and create the content in ways that makes it easy to reuse. 

* A CMS allows a team of contributors to work on the same pages without conflicting (check-in/check-out and workflow control). It can schedule pages to appear and disappear at designated times, and archive the old pages with versioning and revision control. 

* Reuse of content means an item can be edited in one place and be published instantly in many places. But it also means that the different versions of the content can be formatted properly for multiple delivery channels, including the web (HTML and PDF), print, wireless handheld devices, and cell phones. 

* Smaller CMSs are for single web authors working one or a few websites. Enterprise CMSs may control hundreds of thousands of pages on hundreds of websites with many dozens of contributors. In between, there are Team CMSs for corporate departments and smaller organizations. News portal software (slash-alikes and the *nuke family) are a form of community CMS, as are weblog tools (usually for personal publishing) and Wikis (usually for teams of contributors). 

* Some CMSs edit whole web pages, others edit a content template for a page and individual content elements. Both kinds may have form-based text editing, source editing of the markup language, or WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) visual editing. Smaller CMSs tend to be page-oriented and store HTML. Enterprise CMSs use content templates and usually store content elements as information chunks in XML. Some systems tag and store the information with RDF (Resource Description Framework) metadata for the Semantic Web.



<p>First, let’s take a look at the history of content management systems to understand where they come from and what challenges they were designed to solve.</p>

> ## a brief history of content management systems and WWW

<br>

![a brief history of content management systems and WWW](https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-CMS-01.png)



> The first content management systems that were developed in the second half of the 1990’s simplified web development but still required a fairly high level of programming expertise and elbow grease. In the 90’s most websites were still being coded by hand &#8211; from the ground up, so to speak.


> It became apparent during the early days of the web that website development could benefit from ‘platforms’ or ‘frameworks’ &#8211; in other words, development environments that would give sites a jump-start so that website coders had a foundation to work from. Just as modern PHP application frameworks help web developers not to “reinvent the wheel” by providing components to implement basic services, CMSs allowed faster development of message boards and basic HTML websites and obviated the need to develop websites entirely from scratch.

> Some of the early CMSs such as b2/cafelog and Mambo (mentioned in the timeline above) became the basis for contemporary &#8211; and far more advanced &#8211; content management systems. Many others never survived their infancy.

> While early CMS solutions assumed a fair knowledge of HTML coding and programming, CMSs turned over time (to varying degrees) towards visual-based web development. We’ll explore the origins of so-called “WYSIWYG” editors in the next section.


> ### WYSIWYG Website Creation

> WYSIWYG, or “What You See Is What You Get” website building tools emerged around the World Wide Web’s sixth birthday, beginning to appear in 1996. “WYSIWYG” was originally used in reference to text editors that could display a ‘page’ on-screen that mimicked the actual paper copy that would come out of a printer. John Markoff of the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/the-real-history-of-wysiwyg/?_r=0" target="_blank">NY Times (October 2007)</a> suggests: “The first true WYSIWYG editor was a program written for the Alto [computer] called Bravo, created in 1974 by Charles Simonyi and Butler Lampson, which would ultimately lead to the development of Microsoft Word some years later.” Office productivity software offered WYSIWYG document creation as far back as the mid-70’s. WYSIWYG website creation emerged on the scene between 1996 and 1997, though it is arguable that capability of WYSIWYG website editors was seriously lacking even into the early 2000’s. Sites like Wix.com, launched in 2006 and offering cloud-based drag-and-drop website building, emerged a full decade after the first generation of WYSIWYG web development software.


> Examples of early WYSIWYG web development tools are:


> * <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/" target="_blank">Amaya</a> &#8211; W3C’s project that was begun in 1996
> * Dreamweaver &#8211; launched by Macromedia in 1997 and bought by Adobe in 2007
> * GoLive &#8211; started by GoNet Communications in 1996 and acquired by Adobe in 1999


> Each of the modern CMSs we are discussing offer WYSIWYG editing to some degree, though WordPress offers the easiest customizations for those who shy away from coding.


## content management framework

<p>A <b>content management framework</b> (<b>CMF</b>) is a system that facilitates the use of reusable components or customized software for managing Web content. It shares aspects of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework" class="mw-redirect" title="Web application framework">Web application framework</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" title="Content management system">content management system</a> (CMS).</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>WordPress</b></span></p>
<p><i>Recommended for: small and medium-sized companies, organizations, dedicated blogs</i></p>
<p><i>Difficulty level: no programming experience required! (but plenty of potential for experts as well!)</i></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>WordPress is undoubtedly the best content management system for someone who wants to set up and manage a website without having to type a single line of code. <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a> lets anyone set up a WordPress-powered site in minutes, even offering free hosting with a URL in the format of <i>yoursitename</i>.wordpress.com. Note: wordpress.com is not to be confused with wordpress.org, which hosts downloads of WordPress software, themes, and plugins for those who wish to set up a WordPress installation on their own server or web host.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Though it is the easiest to get started with, WordPress does allow for impressive customization and offers a plethora of plugins. Even advanced programmers, web designers, and nerds can find a lot to love about WordPress. Their landing-page boast that “Wordpress powers 24% of the internet” is indicative of the flexibility that this platform provides. WordPress is great not only for personal blogs (for which it may be most famous), but also for commercial websites, for education, for online portfolios, and even in some cases for ecommerce.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>One of WordPress’s greatest strengths is its wide selection of themes and plugins. Many themes are free &#8211; Creative Bloq has a nice list of “<a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/free-wordpress-themes-712429" target="_blank">The 40 best free WordPress themes</a>” published just a few weeks back. Pricing for others varies, but is typically within the range of $25 to $100. With so many themes available you are almost certain to find one that either meets your needs already or that can be easily tailored to your liking with minimal effort.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>WordPress is considered the official successor of b2/cafelog, a blog platform written in PHP by Michel Valdrighi. While b2/cafelog was only ever used by around 2,000 websites, as of 2015 WordPress is powering more than 60 million. Like its predecessor, WordPress is written in PHP and designed to work with MySQL.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>The biggest advantages of WordPress include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>an excellent selection of themes and plugins;</li>
<li>a wide user base and large online support community;</li>
<li>the ability to set up most or all of a website without any coding experience;</li>
<li>a well-designed administration panel;</li>
<li>and regular updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Some of the disadvantages of WordPress are:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>the necessity of multiple plugins for many use cases;</li>
<li>security concerns;</li>
<li>that WordPress is not ideal for ecommerce, though ecommerce extensions do exist;</li>
<li>and that WordPress is less flexible than Drupal or Joomla.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Drupal</b></span></p>
<p><i>Recommended for: business, government, education, civic engagement platforms</i></p>
<p><i>Difficulty level: some programming experience recommended</i></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Like WordPress, Drupal evolved from a project by a single individual. According to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about/history" target="_blank">Drupal’s official website</a>:</p>
<p>“In 2000, permanent Internet connections were at a premium for University of Antwerp students, so Dries Buytaert and Hans Snijder set up a wireless bridge between their student dorms to share Hans&#8217;s ADSL modem connection among eight students. While this was unusual for the time, the friends felt something was missing: there was no means to discuss or share simple things.</p>
<p>This inspired Dries to work on a small news site with a built-in web board, allowing the group of friends to leave each other notes about the status of the network, to announce where they were having dinner, and to share noteworthy news items.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>What started off as a simple message board for friends evolved over time into an open source CMS project that has gone on to power a number of big name websites, the most notable among them being whitehouse.gov. Ever since Howard Dean’s 2004 campaign (noted in the timeline above), Drupal has been embraced by civic activists, community leaders, and government agencies (such as the US Department of Education). It is also used by many news sites, blogs, and well-known institutions including The Economist, Mental Floss, Mother Jones, Mint.com, Columbia University, and the University of Pennsylvania. Even <a href="http://www.monarchie.be/en" target="_blank">The King of Belgium</a> trusts Drupal for his online presence!</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Drupal bills itself as a flexible content management solution that allows sites to grow and evolve with blogs, forums, various and custom types of content, support for ecommerce, and creation of “web applications and mashups using third party APIs.” What Drupal does <i>not </i>consider itself is a one-purpose wonder. Drupal’s Community Documentation is not shy about suggesting that sites whose sole function is a personal blog, wiki, or forum should look elsewhere, citing more targeted solutions such as WordPress, MediaWiki, and SimpleMachines to meet those singular objectives.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Additionally, Drupal is often cited as having a steeper learning curve than WordPress. Chris Sloan argues <a href="http://getlevelten.com/blog/chris-sloan/drupal-learning-curve-too-steep-weak">here</a> that the learning curves of WordPress and Drupal have been converging over time, and that today there is not a significant difference between them. Though this may be true in a general sense, Drupal does have fewer themes and modules than WordPress. With fewer themes there is a greater likelihood that you’ll need to delve into some code customization to get your site looking and functioning exactly as you like. The same documentation cited above proffers the following advice: “Drupal takes time and commitment to learn how to use, and if you or your organization are not prepared to spend some time learning how Drupal works (or if you are not able to hire Drupal expertise), it may not be your best option.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>That said, Drupal is quite powerful and can be a great choice for complex websites, for institutions, for schools, for libraries, and for news sites and blogs.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Drupal has many benefits. It is:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>multi-purpose: a Swiss army knife of content management;</li>
<li>supported by an active online community;</li>
<li>used by governments and institutions, suggesting a high level of security and regular updates;</li>
<li>and it is flexible, ‘future-proofing’ your website by allowing new features to be added without the need to migrate to a new CMS or framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Drupal also has its drawbacks. Drual:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>has fewer themes and modules than WordPress;</li>
<li>is not specifically designed for blogs or single-purpose sites;</li>
<li>and may have a steeper learning curve than WordPress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Joomla</b></span></p>
<p><i>Recommended for: companies, institutions, online communities, complex websites </i></p>
<p><i>Difficulty level: intermediate-advanced programming/ development experience recommended</i></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>At its core Joomla is designed for online communities, though as with Drupal and WordPress it can be used to do a whole lot more such as blogs and ecommerce. Joomla has a steeper learning curve than the other CMSs we have looked at so far. According to<a href="http://www.miracletutorials.com/wordpress-vs-joomla-review/" target="_blank"> this article </a>on Miracle Tutorials: “You really should get a good book on Joomla if you want to set it up fast. Otherwise you end up fiddling around and getting nowhere for days.” You definitely can’t make this statement about WordPress, and likely not about Drupal either!</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a> touts itself as “The only open source, non-corporate backed, community driven CMS in the world.” Note: with reference to WordPress and Drupal, this means that Joomla is pointing out its “non-corporate backed” nature.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Using Object Oriented Programming techniques and a “strong MVC [model-view-controller] design pattern,” Joomla speaks directly to programmers and software developers. Joomla seems to target itself towards programmers and companies who want to develop complex websites. Additionally, the MVC framework that Joomla is based on can be employed independently of the content management system, making Joomla closer to a PHP application framework than a pure CMS per se. Like WordPress and Drupal, Joomla is built on PHP &#8211; meaning that all three of the top content management systems today are built on this server-side scripting language.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>While WordPress is perfect for personal blogs and businesses alike, and Drupal is okay for blogs but more oriented towards multi-purpose sites, Joomla is a heavyweight that wouldn’t be a very good choice for a personal site dedicated to pictures of your cat.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Joomla does support themes, and site layouts can be customized without having to get into the nitty gritty code if you don’t want to. All the same, Joomla’s strength lies in its complexity. If you know what you want, and are willing to learn how to implement it, Joomla can do just about anything you ask.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Joomla’s greatest strengths are its:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>object-oriented nature and MVC design pattern;</li>
<li>community-driven development without corporate intervention;</li>
<li>flexibility, stability, and support;</li>
<li>online community capabilities, including user accounts;</li>
<li>and its focus on Enterprise and small and medium-sized businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Joomla’s weaknesses include its:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>steep learning curve, even for experienced developers;</li>
<li>complex nature, making it less than ideal for basic or single-focus sites;</li>
<li>heavy use of server resources;</li>
<li>and its comparatively smaller number of available extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Quick Comparison of WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla</b></span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla are all free content management systems that are highly capable in their own unique ways. They are all open source; they are all PHP-based. Each provides an official website with themes, extensions and/or modules, and WordPress and Joomla show ratings of their listed themes/ extensions. Note: many other themes, extensions, and modules are also available on a number of third-party sites.</p>
<p>Here is a small chart of database support, approximate adoption rates as a percentage of all websites, and approximate number of extensions/ modules for WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla as of July 2015:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1598 size-full" src="https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10.png" alt="extentions databases" width="674" height="258" srcset="https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10.png 674w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-300x115.png 300w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-570x218.png 570w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-370x142.png 370w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-270x103.png 270w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-300x115@2x.png 600w, https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2015/07/Comp-Tables-10-270x103@2x.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Conclusion: Which CMS is right for you?</b></span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Setting up WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla on most hosting services is incredibly simple. With cPanel, for example &#8211; a popular Linux-based web hosting control panel used by GoDaddy, inMotion Hosting and others &#8211; all three of these platforms can be installed and ready to use with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>The decision of which CMS to choose for you and your business is not easy. If the choice is still not clear to you after reading this article, be sure to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What website functionality do I need today?</li>
<li>What website functionality would I like to add in 1-2 years? In 3-5 years?</li>
<li>Do I intend to start or continue a company blog? Will there be multiple blogs?</li>
<li>What competencies does my development team currently have?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Ideally, whatever CMS you choose today will be able to stay with you for at least several years since switching to a new content management system can be rather costly and time-consuming. Drupal and Joomla may be more flexible in the long-term &#8211; depending on your needs &#8211; while WordPress is simple to get started with right away and may cost the least amount of money to get up and running at the beginning.</p>
